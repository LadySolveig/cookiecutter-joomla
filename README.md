## :bookmark_tabs: About ##

Create your [Joomla!](https://www.joomla.org/) projects swiftly with project templates (cookiecutters) and the awesome command-line utility [Cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/).

Cookiecutter is a templating library for creating boilerplate for projects in any programming language.

Boilerplate templates are gradually being created here to get your next [Joomla!](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/) 4/5 project up and running as quickly as possible.

Hopefully this project can help to lower the entry barrier for developers who want to start a Joomla! project and are not yet very familiar with the development of plugins, modules and components. 🚀

Of course, even experienced Joomla! developers can certainly benefit from the time savings when setting up their projects.
